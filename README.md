# ImageSearchApp-https://iamsurbhi1503.github.io/ImageSearchApp/
This simple Unsplash Image Search app allows users to query the Unsplash API for images based on their search terms. The app displays a set of images along with their details and provides a "Show More" button to load additional search results.

#Features

1. Search Images:

Enter a search query in the input field and submit the form to fetch images based on the provided query.
The initial search fetches a set of images and clears existing results.

2. Show More:

Click the "Show More" button to load additional search results.
The button remains hidden until the second page of results is requested.

3. Details and Links:

Each result includes an image and a link with details.
Clicking on the image opens the Unsplash link in a new tab.

4. Navigation:

Use the "Back" button to navigate back to the previous page.

#Styling and Customization

1. CSS Classes:

The JavaScript code adds specific classes to elements, such as img for images and details for links. Customize these classes to match your styling preferences.

2. Additional Styling:

The provided CSS can be further customized to match your app's design. Add hover effects, animations, and transitions as needed.

#Notes

1. API Rate Limits:

Be mindful of Unsplash API rate limits. Consider implementing user feedback or loading indicators for better user experience.

2. Access Key Security:

Keep your Unsplash API access key secure and avoid exposing it publicly in client-side code for production applications.
